# Task Log

## Cycle 1

- **Date/time:** 2026-07-11T09:51:30+03:00
- **Status:** completed with accepted CI limitation
- **Selected task:** Bootstrap the minimum runnable, testable, buildable, and previewable project baseline.
- **Outcome:** The runnable baseline, local tests, build, generated preview files, and project documents were completed. GitHub Actions repeatedly failed before allocating a runner and was later removed by the repository owner.
- **User direction:** On 2026-07-11, the repository owner explicitly accepted GitHub Actions as unavailable and instructed development to focus on the product.
- **Remaining limitation:** Automated GitHub Actions validation and artifact generation are unavailable until a workflow is intentionally restored in a separate cycle.
- **Git:** Bootstrap and CI-diagnosis work was merged through PRs #1–#4. The workflow was subsequently removed from `main` by owner commit `087984cf2311e36284fc4c3c439236f663116c55`.

## Cycle 2

- **Date/time:** 2026-07-11T09:51:30+03:00
- **Status:** completed
- **Selected task:** Replace the bootstrap shell with the mobile-first landing/discovery state.
- **Goal:** Let a new visitor immediately understand the product and discover one curated challenge without implementing gameplay.
- **Why selected:** Cycle 1 was accepted as complete with CI temporarily unavailable, and landing/discovery was the earliest incomplete roadmap stage.
- **Viral-loop impact:** Establishes the entry point that directs users toward the first playable challenge in the next cycle.

### Acceptance criteria completed

- Replaced the bootstrap status screen with a real mobile-first landing state.
- Kept product copy concise and understandable within seconds.
- Added one curated challenge with category, difficulty, duration, description, and goal.
- Added one working primary action that reveals and hides challenge details.
- Preserved keyboard access, visible focus, semantic labels, and a 48px primary target.
- Kept layout fluid from 320px upward with no fixed-width overflow.
- Added no gameplay, result, sharing, friend attempt, comparison, metrics, or creation behavior.
- Added focused behavior tests for metadata, landing content, and the discovery action.

### Strategic review

- Direction remains aligned with the discover-to-compete north star.
- The landing bottleneck is resolved; the next bottleneck is absence of playable challenge behavior.
- Temporary lack of automated CI remains the largest delivery risk.
- No evidence invalidates the static HTML/CSS/JavaScript architecture.
- The first playable curated challenge is now the highest-impact next task.

### Product thinking

1. The bootstrap-only page blocked discovery; this is now resolved.
2. A visible featured challenge and immediate action make the original player more likely to continue.
3. Clear challenge identity improves the later shared-link first impression for a friend.
4. The smallest proof was one concise landing state with one featured challenge and one working discovery action.
5. No useful new idea this cycle.

### Intentional non-goals preserved

- No playable challenge logic.
- No score or result state.
- No sharing, copied links, friend flow, or comparison.
- No dependencies, framework, backend, login, analytics, or workflow restoration.

### Files changed

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`
- `test/landing.test.js`
- `docs/index.html`
- `docs/styles.css`
- `docs/app.js`
- `ROADMAP.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `TASK_LOG.md`

### Verification

- `npm test`: passed using Node.js `v22.16.0`; 3 tests passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run build`: passed; 3 files copied to `dist/` and `docs/`.
- Source/output comparison: `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `app.js` matched generated `docs/` files in the verification workspace.
- Static mobile review: fluid `min(100%, 30rem)` shell, 320px body minimum, wrapping metadata, full-width 48px action, no fixed-width overflow source.
- Accessibility review: semantic heading structure, labelled section, `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, keyboard-native button, visible `:focus-visible` outline.
- Secret review: no secrets, tokens, environment values, or personal identifiers added.
- GitHub Actions: unavailable because the workflow was removed by the repository owner; not claimed as passed.
- Preview: not verified live for this branch because GitHub Pages deployment status for the branch is unavailable and Actions artifacts are disabled.

### Decision

No new product or architecture decision. The owner’s explicit direction is treated as acceptance of temporary CI unavailability, not as a permanent architecture change.

### Git

- Branch: `agent/cycle-2-landing-discovery`
- Commits: multiple focused connector commits were required because the available GitHub contents API writes one file per commit.
- Pull request: created after finalizing this cycle log.

### Remaining limitation

Live mobile browser verification and deployed-preview verification are unavailable in the current tool environment. Automated CI is also unavailable until restored intentionally.

### Next suggested task

Implement the first playable curated challenge using the existing Tap Sprint identity and shared landing flow. Do not implement the result screen until gameplay is complete.
